OVERVIEW OFTHE PROJECT:

Project: Analysis On Movie Reviews Using IMDB Movie Review Dataset


Objective:

The objective of this Project is to perform Analysis On Movie Reviews on a dataset containing differnt types of reviews stating the sentiment of sentence whether it is Positive or Negative 0r Neutral using Sentiment Analysis.


Key Features:

1.Sentiment Classification: Classify reviews into categories like Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

2.Text Preprocessing: Tokenize and convert the text into a structured format suitable for machine learning models.

3.Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical features using techniques like Bag-of-Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

4.Model Training: Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) or deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) for sentiment classification.

5.Evaluation: Measure model performance using metrics like Accuracy, loss, Precision.


Tools And Technologies:

1.Python: The primary programming language for implementing the project.

2.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Specifically, LSTM is used for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data like text.

3.Embeddings: Word embeddings (learned during training) help in converting words into dense vector forms for better contextual understanding.

4.Libraries Used: 

  1.Keras: Used for deep learning model development.

  2.Keras.datasets: Provides the IMDb dataset, a pre-processed dataset of movie reviews with sentiment labels.

  3.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences: Used for padding sequences to ensure uniform input length for the model.

  4.TensorFLow: Provides the backend for Keras and handles computations on GPUs or CPUs.

5.Tools Used:

  1.Binary Cross-Entropy: Used for binary classification tasks.

  2.Adam Optimizer: Adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.

  3.Accuracy: Evaluates the performance of the model.
